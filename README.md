# REST API library/reader-subscriber/book web server ðŸ“šâœ¨

Welcome to LibraConnect, your gateway to a world of literary wonders! This repository showcases the fantastic Homework 4 project, where we've created a seamless client-server interaction for a library system.

## Project Inspiration ðŸŒŸ
Built upon the foundation of lab9 from the PCOM course, LibraConnect is a labor of inspiration and innovation. We've added our touch, introducing a `compute_delete_request` function and refining request types to seamlessly integrate JWT tokens. The magic of JSON object parsing comes alive with the Parson library by Kgabis, adding an extra layer of brilliance to the project.

## Dive into Testing ðŸš€
Curious minds, rejoice! Explore the journey of LibraConnect through hands-on testing.

## Unveiling the Code Symphony ðŸŽ¶
### Main Function
Embark on the adventure with the `main` function, orchestrating the program's dance of variables, memory allocation, user command processing, and graceful termination.

### Function: code
The heartbeat of LibraConnect, the `code` function, translates command strings into a symphony of command codes. A harmonious dance of commands awaits!

### Function: remove_whitespace
Join the rhythm of the `remove_whitespace` function, elegantly sweeping away unnecessary characters and creating a clean canvas for commands.

### Function: extract_cookie_elements
Watch as `extract_cookie_elements` gracefully separates cookie elements, ensuring a delightful array of tokens for smooth interactions.

### Function: get_last_line
Step into the spotlight with `get_last_line`, stealing the scene as it finds the last line containing a target substring â€“ a true hero in the search for relevance.

### Function: print_fields
A crescendo of elegance, the `print_fields` function serenades the user with JSON array melodies, printing the enchanting values of selected fields.

### Exit Handler: A Graceful Finale
In the grand finale, the `exit_handler` gracefully exits the stage, leaving behind the echo of "204 - No Content." A standing ovation for a successful performance!
